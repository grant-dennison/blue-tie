## Running Tests

This library is intended to help in both Node.js and browser runtime environments.
So there are tests for both.

### Node.js Tests

```
npm test
```

### Browser Tests

In your local CLI:

```
npm run browser-tests
```

While that is running, open [http://localhost:8030] in your browser.
Refreshing the page will rerun the tests with the latest.
